    <h1>Why The Future is Not in the Cloud</h1>
    <p>Likely as not, you are aware of the massive move of complex software to the cloud. This is due to the era of machine learning, the most exciting and promising field of AI to date. Specficially, the type of machine learning known as neural networks, and more specifically convulsion networks. These data models are immensely useful and accurate, but running them is quite costly in terms of computing resources and power. And so began the age of smaller devices connecting to large servers to complete the work. For large companies, this is nothing but good news. They can offer their users products and services which are tailored to them, and provide incredible insights never before possible, while also collecting useful analyitcal information about their users. And better still is the fact that they can now collect data from their users, rather than spending the money to gather the training data for their algorithms.(continued later)</p>
