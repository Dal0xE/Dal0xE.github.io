  <center><p style="font-family:Courier;color:gray;font-size:17px;">I'm Dallas, a 14 year old developer with many various interests in security research, machine learning (AI), and quite particularly iOS. This site is mainly for me to host a few various files, publish write-ups on some of my work, and otherwise mess around with web-type things.</p></center>

  <center><p style="font-family:Courier;color:gray;font-size:17px;">Here you might find some of my projects I host here. Fair warning, most of them are highly experimental.</p></center>
